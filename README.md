# Week_1_HomeWork
Week 1's homework is to improve a current company's website without actually changing the website. It is Due April 3 at 11:59pm
First big changes made were to improve the semantics of the top portion of the webpage which includes the name of the company/title of the website "Horiseon" and the clickable links "Search Engine Optimization", "Online Reputation Management", and "Social Media Marketing"
The current web page was using <div></div> to seperate into sections and then using "class=" to connect to the CSS. I decided to get rid of the first <div></div> that contained the entire top portion of the website and instead put <header></header>. By doing this I no longer need a class called "header" I can just reference the <header></header> element in the CSS.
I kept the <h1></h1> brakets around the title "Horiseon" because that clearly defines what it is, it is the first header line of the website. In the CSS is changed the ".header h1" to just "h1" because we no longer need to use the ".header" class.
I have not changed the "span" part of <span class="seo">seo</span> that is within the header. I did change it to an id tho <span id="seo">seo</span> because it is so specific it makes more sense to make it an ID instead of class. The css then went from ".header h1 .seo" within CSS to just "#seo" to  designate that those letters need to be grey while the rest of the word is white. I haven't decided that I will change span to yet, but its definitely vague so I will find a better element to put there.
Since I changed the first <div></div> to  <header></header> i decided that it made since to change the next <div></div> that contains the clickable links to <nav></nav> since it is in fact our navagation bar throughout the webpage. I did not see a reason to change the <ul></ul> and <li></li> brackets yet so I kept those the same. 
Now I can change a couple more things in CSS. ".header div" became "nav" which designates the padding, margin, float, font-family and font-size of all the listed links.
I changed ".header div ul" to "ul" which changes the list-style-type: none so there are no longer bullet points.
and finally I changed ".header div ul li" to "li" which makes the display:inline-block and margin-left:25px.
I did not feel the need to change <a></a> but I might see if i can combine <a></a> with either ul or li in CSS to make it more compact.
